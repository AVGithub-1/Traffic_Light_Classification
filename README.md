# Traffic_Light_Classification
I made a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow to classify images of traffic lights form the LISA Traffic Light Dataset as either stop or go. <br>
To use it, you will first need to download the LISA Traffic Light Dataset and then change the path in the Jupyter Notebook.
